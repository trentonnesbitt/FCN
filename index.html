          <h2>Examples of things and stuff we've done</h2>
          <h4>Things</h4><p>What are things? Well, they are like stuff, except they aren't stuff. They are their own things by themselves, but they can also be things together. Where do you think anything got it's name from? Things, that's what. You ever look at something online and your like, "what is that thing?" Well we got it, and we have loads of them. </p>
          <h4>Stuff</h4><p>What is stuff? Well, they are similar to things, but they are stuff instead. It's not anything in particular, its just 'stuff' ya' know? If you think too hard about it, they become things, and things however similar, are definitely not stuff. Have you ever look at something and thought what is that thing made of? Chances are it's stuff. And we have the stuff to make that thing work.</p>
          <h4>Examples</h4><p>What is an example? An example can be anything, it can be things, stuff, or none of the previous words mentioned. And we don't just do your "average" example. We exemplify examples. We are the prime example of a good example maker. If you want an example, then look at us, because we are it.</p>
          <h4>Proof</h4><p>What is proof? Proof is what you need when you have run dry of all the things, stuff, and examples you can buy. What was left when Pandora opened her box? Do you know? It was the box, and that box was proof that it happened. And that's what we will provide for you, <del>Pandora's box</del>, I mean proof. We have all the proof you need, free from the strings, evidence, histories, truth, and anything else that might get in the way of how you want tell your story.</p>
